        <ul class="mt-3" type="1">
          <li>Give students a short form or survey - <i>include options to list their individual skills and strengths
              (see the Group Formation form link below. Thanks to Dr. Tami Meredith for sharing)</i></li>
          <li>Create groups based on students' skills and strengths</li>
          <li>Give each individual a role in the group - <i>i.e., leader/manager, lead programmer, technical writer,
              researcher etc. <strong>(Ensure women and people who are perceived to be female are not relegated to purely document writing or presenting - they
                also need an opportunity to code!)</strong></i></li>
          <li>Include peer feedback - <i>students must evaluate the performance of others in the group</i></li>
          <li><i>(Added as suggestion - students should be able to highlight to the instructor if they feel strongly
              about NOT working with a particular student)</i></li>

        <h2 class="mt-5 title bold">Group work - not all methods are the same</h2>
        <div class="mt-3">Group work (also known as cooperative learning) is a valuable method of instruction that can
          be implemented in classes to allow students to work together to produce projects, research papers etc. It
          supports cooperation and collaboration among individuals for a common purpose.</div>
        <div class="mt-3">There are many methods to formulating groups:</div>
        <ul class="mt-3">
          <li>students can create their own groups</li>
          <li>instructors can group students to generate a balance of genders, ethnicities, cultures, etc.</li>
          <li>instructors can create groups according to students abilities</li>
          <li>instructors can create groups according to skill and strengths</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mt-3"><i>All the above methods can be effective if implemented correctly, however, <strong>research
              suggests that instructor created groups are the most effective in developing new trusting relationships,
              an important interpersonal skill.</strong> Most students believe that student created groups are more
            effective, <strong>but research suggests this simply is not true (Hilton and Philips, 2010).</strong></i>

        <h2 class="mt-5 bold title">Some Advice for your Students BEFORE they Begin their Project</h2>
        <div class="mt-4 bold">Know What You Want</div>
        <div class="mt-3">Talk with your teammates about the quality of work your team aspires to produce and the amount
          of commitment to reach that goal. What type of team do you want to be? Define the general rules by which the
          team will work. How will the team determine who does what? How often will you meet, and for how long? How will
          you keep in touch between meetings? Spending a few minutes at the start to put these "rules" in writing can
          save you much frustration and disappointment later.</div>

        <div class="mt-4 bold">Plan How to Get There</div>
        <div class="mt-3">Team projects can feel overwhelming at first, and you may be tempted to quickly split-up the
          work so that everyone can get started on it. Do not do this. Take time to identify:</div>
        <ul class="mt-4" type="1">
          <li>The specific steps needed to complete the project</li>
          <li>The skills required at each step</li>
          <li>The strengths of each team member. Two benefits of being in a team are that you do not have to be an
            expert in <strong>everything</strong> and you do not have to do it all yourself. So, assign work to team
            members based on their strengths and workload, ensuring that everyone gets to do their fair share. Research
            shows that teams earn better grades when everyone participates in a meaningful way</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="mt-4 bold">Work as a Team</div>
        <div class="mt-3">Teams are more than just groups of people. To be a team, you must be committed to the same
          goal and be willing to “step up” when you can. Teams can accomplish much when working as a single unit, but
          not without the individual effort made by team members. Research shows that the highest project grades are
          earned when team members work together bringing their skills and abilities to bear on each task.</div>

        <div class="mt-4 bold">Build the Team</div>
        <div class="mt-3">Teams rarely are perfect when they first start. It takes time to build the trust that is
          needed when relying on others. Help each other along by scheduling times to review each other’s work and to
          give constructive feedback on how it can be improved. As a team, assess the whole team’s performance and the
          openness of its communications. Do this often, and small difficulties will be less likely to turn into big
          problems.</div>
